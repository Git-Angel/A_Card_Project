# Frontend Mentor - Interactive Card Details Form Solution

This is my solution to the [Interactive Card Details Form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw). The goal was to build a visually appealing and interactive credit card form that validates user input and displays real-time feedback — all while staying responsive across different devices.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real time
- Receive validation messages for:
  - Empty input fields
  - Incorrect formats (e.g., card number not 16 digits, CVC not 3 digits)
- Submit successfully and see a thank-you screen
- View the correct layout based on device size (mobile/desktop)
- Experience transitions and hover/focus states for interactive elements
